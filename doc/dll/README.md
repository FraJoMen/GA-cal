**The dependency problem**

When compiling the executable in the [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) environment, the software could wrongly set the paths to the foreign libraries. In this case, 
launching the executable with a double click,  we get an error like this:

*Code execution cannot continue because \*.dll was not found.*

One way to solve this problem is to copy the *.dll files in this folder into the executable file folder.
